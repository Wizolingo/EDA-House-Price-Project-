## Music and Mental Health (EDA)
Mental health is determined by many factors ranging from socioeconomic, biological to environmental factors.
Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. 
MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.
This case study aims to Identify if there exists any correlation between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental condition.
